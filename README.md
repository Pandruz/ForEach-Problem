# ForEach-Problem
[SwiftUI] ForEach doesn't update content, even though it gets stored correctly

As I mentioned in the reddit post ( https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/comments/js8dwt/swiftui_foreach_doesnt_update_content_even_though/ ) values get stored correctly, but don't get shown when added to the "values". I commented or removed everything that wasn't necessary for this, so that you don't get lost in all the (probably stupid, since I'm still a learning noob) code.

I truly hope that you'll be able to help me!

Thank you!
